# ðŸ”¡ Custom fonts

You can change the default font to one of your choosing by hosting them your self or by importing them directly via google fonts. Link them in your `public/index.html` file and create a new theme provider with Onyxia-ui, then set the `ThemeProvider` property in the `GlTemplate` component to the new theme provider.

### Adding multiple fonts

Change one or more of the font variants in the theme provider by setting the `fontFamily` in the `variants` property to your chosen font.

[This commit is an example where I change the `page heading` variant to `Playfair Display` and the `subtitle` variant to `Open Sans.`](https://github.com/thieryw/crispy-octo-bassoon/commit/7a2003d285d8f3a6b2d5391474af5cc691f03910)``
